1. **Mode Switch**: Set mode to 'dark'. Verify the `<html>` element has `data-theme="dark"`. Set mode to 'system' and change OS theme; verify the app's theme follows.
2. **Accent Color**: Update accent color to `#EB5A46`. Verify the CSS variable `--accent` is updated and that buttons reflect the new color.
3. **Radius Slider**: Change corner radius to `0`. Verify cards and buttons have sharp corners. Change to `16`; verify they are highly rounded.
4. **Persistence**: Set a custom theme (e.g., dark mode, red accent). Reload the page. Verify the custom theme is restored.
5. **Export/Import**: Export the current theme. Reset to defaults. Import the saved theme file. Verify the original theme is correctly restored.
